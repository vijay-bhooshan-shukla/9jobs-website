const faqs = [
  [
    "Why am I getting automatic rejection emails?",
    "Automatic rejection emails are typically triggered by applicant tracking software (ATS). If your resume does not pass basic formatting checks, lacks critical keywords, or fails specific screening questions (e.g. visa parameters), the system will automatically reject you before a human reviews your file."
  ],
  [
    "How can I tell if my resume is ATS-friendly?",
    "If your resume uses columns, text boxes, tables, images, or custom fonts, it is likely not ATS-friendly. Test your resume by copy-pasting the text into a plain text editor (like Notepad). If the formatting scrambled or text disappears, the ATS will also fail to parse it."
  ],
  [
    "Does visa status affect interview calls?",
    "Yes. Australian employers prioritize candidates with full working rights due to compliance regulations. If your visa status is restricted or not specified on your profile, talent teams will skip your application. State your work eligibility clearly."
  ],
  [
    "Should I follow up with recruiters after applying?",
    "Yes. A brief, professional follow-up call or email 3-4 days after applying can help you stand out. Sourcing teams handle large volumes of applications, and a polite inquiry demonstrates active interest."

          <h2>The Frustration of the Silent Job Search</h2>
          <p>
            One of the most discouraging experiences in a career transition is submitting dozens of applications only to receive silence or generic automatic rejections (&quot;We regret to inform you...&quot;). Many candidates believe they lack the experience required for the roles they target.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, in most cases, rejections are not caused by a lack of capability. They are caused by structural errors in your application funnel: formatting issues that block scanner parsing, missing keywords, incorrect visibility parameters, or visa status uncertainty. This guide explains why this happens and how to fix it.
          </p>

          <h2>Reason 1: Your Resume is Getting Blocked by ATS Filters</h2>
          <p>
            Over 75% of resumes submitted online are filtered out automatically by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). If your file uses design templates (with columns, text boxes, tables, or graphs), the parser will scramble the text.
          </p>
          <p>
            To fix this, rebuild your resume using a clean, single-column format. Remove graphics, charts, and non-standard fonts. Read our [Resume Writing Services](/resume-writing-services-australia) guide to learn how to structure an ATS-friendly layout.
          </p>

          <h2>Reason 2: You Lack Relevant Sourcing Keywords</h2>
          <p>
            Recruiters use search filters to query candidate databases on platforms like SEEK or LinkedIn. If your profile lacks target industry terms and skill tags, you will be excluded from search queries before you apply.
          </p>
          <p>
            Review local job listings, identify repeating technical terms, tools, or certifications in your field, and add them to your resume and digital profiles. Read our [LinkedIn Optimization](/linkedin-optimization-australia) and [SEEK Optimization](/seek-profile-optimization) guides to configure your keywords correctly.
          </p>

          </div>

          <h2>Reason 3: Your Visa Status or Availability is Unclear</h2>
          <p>
            Australian employers are highly cautious about visa compliance. Sourcing teams prioritize candidates who state their work rights clearly. If your profile summary is silent about your eligibility, hiring managers will assume you require sponsorship, leading to quick rejections.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clearly state your visa status (e.g. &quot;Full working rights, Permanent Residency Subclass 190&quot;) at the top of your resume and in your profile summaries. This builds instant trust and clears compliance checks.
          </p>

          <h2>Reason 4: Lack of Daily Application Consistency</h2>
          <p>
            Job vacancies in Australia are filled quickly. Sourcing teams start contacting candidates within 48 hours of posting. If you only apply in batches on weekends, you miss out on high-priority roles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apply to roles daily as they are listed. 9Jobs offers a professional [Job Application Service](/job-application-services-australia) where our team researches and submits applications on your behalf daily, maintaining consistency.
          </p>

          <h2>Reason 5: Weak Phone Screen Performance</h2>
          <p>
            If you pass the initial screen, you will receive phone screening calls. Sourcing teams use these conversations to verify basic parameters. If you cannot explain your background, working rights, and salary expectations clearly, you will be filtered out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prepare for screening calls by structuring your achievements using the STAR method. For mock interview practice and communication coaching, check our [Interview Support](/interview-support-australia) program.

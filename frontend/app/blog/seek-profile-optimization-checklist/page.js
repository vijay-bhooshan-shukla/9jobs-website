          <p>SEEK is the absolute market leader for recruitment and job postings in Australia. The vast majority of employers and agencies in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide use SEEK to advertise vacancies and search the SEEK Candidate Search database for talent. If your SEEK profile is incomplete, set to private, or lacks target keywords, you are missing out on a massive portion of the job market. Sourcing teams use the database to identify candidates for unadvertised roles and contract opportunities. To help you maximize your visibility and secure more callbacks, we have compiled the ultimate SEEK Profile Optimization Checklist. Follow these steps to align your profile with recruiter search patterns.</p>

          
          <h2>1. Configure Your Search Visibility Settings</h2>
          <p>The most critical step in optimizing your SEEK profile is setting your visibility to 'Standard.' If your profile is set to 'Hidden' or 'Limited,' recruiters cannot discover you in search queries. Standard visibility allows verified recruiters to view your full profile, resume, and contact information, enabling them to message you directly with opportunities. Double-check your account settings to ensure standard visibility is enabled. For specialized assistance, you can leverage our <Link href="/services/seek-profile-optimization">SEEK Profile Optimization</Link> service.</p>
  

          <h2>2. Set Your Location and Commuter Preferences</h2>
          <p>Recruiters search for talent based on geographic radiuses. If you do not specify a location, or if your location is set to regional areas while you are targeting CBD roles, your profile will remain invisible in search lists. Set your primary location to your target city (e.g. Melbourne VIC or Sydney NSW). If you are open to commuting to surrounding regions, configure your sub-location preferences to show you are willing to work in those areas. This ensures your profile shows up in local recruiter search queries.</p>
  

          <h2>3. Write a Keyword-Rich Professional Summary</h2>
          <p>SEEK's search algorithm matches candidates based on the keywords in their profile summary and work history. Write a concise, metrics-focused professional summary detailing your years of experience, core technical skills, and key achievements. Structure the text to contain the exact phrases used in job advertisements in your industry. Avoid generic buzzwords and focus on demonstrating your value. You can align this summary with your LinkedIn profile using our <Link href="/services/linkedin-optimization">LinkedIn Optimization Australia</Link> service.</p>
  

          <h2>4. Upload an ATS-Friendly Resume</h2>
          <p>When a recruiter views your SEEK profile, they will download your uploaded resume. If your resume uses a complex format, multiple columns, or graphics, it may parse poorly in the employer's internal databases. Ensure that your uploaded resume is a clean, single-column chronological Word document or text-searchable PDF. For expert drafting that complies with these standards, consult our <Link href="/services/resume-writing">Resume Writing Services Australia</Link> team.</p>
  

          <h2>5. Maintain Application Momentum and Volume</h2>
          <p>An optimized SEEK profile increases inbound recruiter inquiries, but you must also actively apply to newly listed vacancies. Applying early is critical because recruitment cycles move quickly. Our professional <Link href="/services/job-application-automation">Job Application Service Australia</Link> handles the daily search and submission process for you. We tailor your applications and submit them daily to ensure you maintain a consistent pipeline of opportunities.</p>

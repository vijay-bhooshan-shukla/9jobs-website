    "Why is SEEK important for finding a job in Australia?",
    "SEEK is the absolute leader in the Australian job market. Almost all companies, recruitment firms, and HR departments use SEEK to post jobs and search for candidates. Having an optimized SEEK profile is just as critical as having a good resume or LinkedIn profile because it allows recruiters to find you in their search queries."
  ],
  [
    "What is the difference between a SEEK profile and a resume?",
    "Your resume is a document you upload and send when applying. Your SEEK profile is a digital profile index that lives on the platform. Recruiter search tools scan your SEEK profile text and skills tags to filter candidates. If your profile is empty or lacks keywords, you will not show up in searches, even if your uploaded resume is perfect."
  ],
  [
    "How does the SEEK optimization service work?",
    "We review your current profile, uploaded resume, and target roles in Australia. We then provide a document containing optimized copy for your SEEK summary, experience, skills, and settings. We also guide you on setting up search preferences and alert parameters."
  ],
  [
    "Should my SEEK profile be set to 'Standard' or 'Limited' privacy?",
    "We recommend setting your profile to 'Standard' (fully visible to recruiters) when actively looking for work. This allows registered employers and recruitment agencies to search for you, read your summary, view your uploaded resume, and contact you directly. We help you configure these settings safely."
  ],
  [
    "Can you help me set up SEEK job alerts?",
    "Yes. We advise you on the best salary ranges, job classifications, and keywords to set up for your daily alerts to ensure you receive relevant, high-impact opportunities directly in your inbox."

            <h2>Why an optimized SEEK profile is essential for your job <span className="heading-mark">search</span></h2>
            <p>
              In Australia, SEEK handles the majority of online recruitment activity. When companies have open roles, their talent sourcing teams do not just wait for applications to roll in. They actively search the SEEK candidate database using search queries based on role title, location, salary parameters, and key skill terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your SEEK profile lacks a structured summary, has missing experiences, or is set to incorrect privacy modes, you miss out on a massive stream of potential recruiter outreach. 9Jobs specializes in configuring SEEK profiles to pass filtering checks, rank high in searches, and clearly communicate your value to hiring teams.

            <p>
              To get the most value out of SEEK, candidates must treat their profile as a dynamic landing page. The SEEK search algorithm index fields in a specific hierarchy: your current job title, your skills checklist, your profile summary, and your past roles. Leaving these fields blank or copying-pasting generic resumes limits your reach.
            </p>
            <p>
              The profile summary is particularly critical. This is a 150 to 200 word summary that recruiters see first in search results. It must state your core expertise, key achievements, years of experience, and location availability. If you are relocating or holding a visa with working rights, this summary is the perfect place to communicate that information to preemptively bypass location-based filtering.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another common mistake is setting incorrect location and salary preferences. Recruiters filter database searches strictly based on salary bounds. If your profile lists a target salary range that does not match local benchmarks or target role values, you will be excluded from recruiter dashboards. We review local salary indicators to configure these ranges correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, we ensure that your uploaded resume matches the text on your digital profile. SEEK provides automated matching scores to recruiters by scanning the difference between your profile fields and your uploaded document. A close match ensures a high compatibility score, boosting your visibility.

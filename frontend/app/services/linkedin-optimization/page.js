    "Why is LinkedIn optimization important for finding jobs in Australia?",
    "Over 90% of recruiters in Australia use LinkedIn Recruiter to actively search for and source candidates before posting job ads. If your profile is not optimized with the right keywords, locations, and settings, you will not show up in their search lists. An optimized profile ensures you receive inbound inquiries from hiring managers rather than relying solely on manual applications."
  ],
  [
    "How does the LinkedIn optimization service work?",
    "We start by reviewing your current profile and target job descriptions in Australia. Our copywriters then draft an optimization document containing a custom headline, a revised 'About' section, optimized job descriptions for your experience section, and a checklist of recommended settings. You can copy-paste this content directly into your profile or have our team guide you through it."
  ],
  [
    "What settings should I change for an Australian job search?",
    "Key settings include updating your target location to your desired Australian city, setting your status to 'Open to Work' (which can be configured to be visible only to recruiters), and aligning your industry classification with local expectations. We review all these settings to make sure your profile is visible to local sourcing teams."
  ],
  [
    "Will this service help if I am currently outside Australia?",
    "Yes. If you have visa rights or are planning a relocation, we advise you on how to format your location, summary, and headline to indicate your availability to Australian employers. This helps prevent your profile from being filtered out because of international location settings."
  ],
  [
    "Do you write custom LinkedIn content from scratch?",
    "Yes. All summaries, headlines, and descriptions are custom-written from scratch based on your specific career history, skills, and the target market requirements in Australia."

            <p>
              In the modern Australian job market, applying for jobs manually is only half the battle. A large percentage of professional, corporate, and technology roles are never advertised publicly. Instead, recruitment agencies and internal talent acquisition teams use a tool called LinkedIn Recruiter to find matching profiles based on strict filters: location, job titles, key skills, and industry terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your profile lacks relevant keywords or specifies an overseas location without indicating relocation availability, you remain invisible in these search results. 9Jobs understands the algorithms behind LinkedIn's search system. We optimize your profile's headlines, summary, and experience sections so you rank high in searches and receive inbound interview inquiries.

            <p>
              A successful LinkedIn profile in Australia does not simply copy the bullet points of a resume. It serves as a narrative of your career history. While a resume is a formal document targeted at a specific application, your LinkedIn profile is a public landing page designed to attract interest, build credibility, and encourage recruiters to start a conversation.
            </p>
            <p>
              The most critical real estate on your profile is the headline. Most people write their current job title (e.g. &quot;Software Engineer at XYZ Corp&quot;). However, recruiters do not search for company names; they search for roles and capabilities. A headline like &quot;Software Engineer | Full Stack Developer | React, Node.js, AWS | Building Scalable SaaS Applications&quot; is much more effective because it lists multiple target keywords that match search queries.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 'About' section is where you tell your story. It should begin with a strong hook summarizing your experience, key industry expertise, and what you specialize in. Crucially, it must also include a clear statement about your location preference and visa status in Australia. If a recruiter matches your profile but is unsure if you are located in Australia or have legal working rights, they may skip your profile to save time. State your status clearly to build instant trust.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, you must actively align your skills list. LinkedIn allow you to list up to 50 skills, and recruiters filter profiles based on these exact tags. We review local job listings to identify the most common skills requested in your field, and make sure those terms appear prominently in your skills section and throughout your job descriptions.

    "Why do I need a specific resume format for Australia?",
    "Australian recruiters and hiring managers expect resumes to follow specific conventions: a length of 2 to 3 pages, reverse-chronological order, a concise professional summary, and key achievements clearly highlighted with metrics. In addition, almost all mid-to-large companies in Australia use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to filter resumes before human eyes see them. A general global resume might fail these local systems due to formatting errors or lack of localized keywords."
  ],
  [
    "What is an ATS-friendly resume?",
    "An ATS-friendly resume is designed to be easily read and parsed by applicant tracking software. It avoids elements like text boxes, graphics, charts, headers, footers, or non-standard fonts that can scramble the data during scanning. It also incorporates relevant, targeted keywords matching the specific job advertisement to ensure your profile ranks highly in search results when recruiters filter candidates."
  ],
  [
    "How long does the resume writing process take?",
    "Once we receive your current resume and gather information about your target roles in Australia, our writing team drafts a complete ATS-optimized resume. The first draft is typically delivered within 3 to 5 business days. We then work with you through a review process to incorporate feedback, finalize the wording, and get it ready for active job applications."
  ],
  [
    "Do you write resumes for technical IT and non-technical roles?",
    "Yes. Our writing team has extensive experience across both sectors. For IT professionals (Developers, Data Analysts, Cloud Engineers), we emphasize technical stacks, systems, and methodologies. For non-IT professionals (Sales, Operations, HR, Finance), we focus on business values, leadership, process improvement, and local client service experience."
  ],
  [
    "Do you provide cover letters alongside the resume?",
    "Yes. Alongside resume writing, we offer tailored cover letter templates and customized cover letters matching your applications to ensure a cohesive, professional narrative across your entire profile."

            <h2>Why a generic resume fails in the Australian job <span className="heading-mark">market</span></h2>
            <p>
              Applying for jobs in Australia is a highly competitive process. Every advertised position on platforms like SEEK or Jora receives dozens or even hundreds of applications. To manage this volume, recruiters rely on digital scanners (Applicant Tracking Systems) to automatically filter out up to 75% of candidates before a human recruiter even views a file.
            </p>
            <p>
              A resume that has too much graphics, uses multi-column tables, or fails to list localized keywords gets automatically scrambled or classified as irrelevant. 9Jobs understands how local hiring workflows operate. We rewrite your resume to clear the digital hurdles, focus on localized requirements, and present your profile in a format Australian employers expect.

            <p>
              When applying for roles in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, or other Australian cities, writing a resume is not just about translating your work history into bullet points. It requires matching the local employer expectations. In Australia, hiring teams expect to see a clear list of target skills, a concise professional summary that states your eligibility/visa status clearly, a summary of your career milestones, and a clear education history.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the biggest mistakes international applicants make is using a CV format that is too long or contains details like date of birth, marital status, or a profile photo. In Australia, due to anti-discrimination laws, recruiters actively dislike seeing personal details or photos on a resume. A standard, highly-focused document of 2 to 3 pages is the golden standard.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another critical element is the format of your accomplishments. Writing descriptions like &quot;Responsible for managing client database&quot; is not enough. You must show the value: &quot;Managed a SQL database of 10,000+ client profiles, implementing security updates that reduced access latency by 15%.&quot; 9Jobs specializes in converting standard descriptions into outcomes that prove your business capability.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, we ensure that your resume works in tandem with your other online profiles. When a recruiter finds your resume on SEEK or receives it in an application, they will immediately search for you on LinkedIn. If the details, dates, or titles on your resume do not match your online presence, it raises immediate red flags. We ensure consistency across all surfaces so you present a clean, unified brand.
